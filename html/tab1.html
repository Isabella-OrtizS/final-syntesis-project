<h3>Galilean relativity</h3>
<p>
  The laws of mechanics are the same for all inertial observers, observers who
  They move with constant speed relative to each other. The various observers
  correlate their observation through Galilean relativity and Thus, when in the
  expression of a law of mechanics we carry out one of such transformations, the
  law does not change, its form remains unchanged

Two reference frames in relative motion of uniform rectilinear translation are
mechanical equivalent; that is, the mechanical experiments
they develop equally in both, and the laws of mechanics are the same. '

<h4>Inertial reference field</h4>
</p>
An inertial frame of reference is one in which Newton’s laws of motion are
valid. It is an accelerated reference framework. An inertial framework must be homogeneous and
isotropic. Physical experiments can be carried out in different frames of reference
inertial.
An inertial system is a coordinate system in which bodies move in a manner
in a straight line and no force acts on them. This behavior is based on the
Galileo’s law of inertia. Inertia is when a body is kept in motion while
no force acts upon him

  <h5>Transformation of the Galilean</h5>
</p>
An event is specified by its location and time (x, y, z, t) in relation to a
particular inertial reference S. As an example, (x, y, z, t) could denote the position of a
particle in time t, we could be looking at these positions for many times
to follow the motion of the particle. Suppose a second frame of
reference S&#39;
moves with a velocity v relative to the first. To simplify, suppose this
relative velocity is along the x-axis. The relationship between time and coordinates in the.
two frames of reference is then.
Denote particle velocity by u instead of v to avoid confusion with velocity
from one frame of reference to another. The speeds in each frame differ in
speed that has one frame seen from the other. Observers in both frames
reference measurement the same acceleration value. As the mass does not change by transformation,
and distances between points are not loaded, observers in both frames see the
same forces F=ma
that act between objects and the same form of Newton’s second and third laws in all
inertial. The laws of mechanics are consistent with the first postulate of
relativity.
