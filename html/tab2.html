<h3>=Special relativity=</h3>
<p>
  The theory of special relativity, also known as the assumption of restricted
  relativity, is a theory of the most important theories in the field of
  physics, published in 1905 by Albert Einstein- (1879-1955). Which basically
  states that light travels at 300,000 km/s and that nothing in the world can
  overcome this speed. In addition, what is space and time are flexible or not
  absolute magnitudes, their perception is relative to the person. An example,
  if for person number one, a video lasted 30 minutes, for person number 2 it
  can last 10 minutes. So physical magnitudes like, space, time, mass, moment
  and many more depend on the expectation of each observer.

  <br />
  <br />
  -Where "E" is the energy
  <br />
  -"m" is mass
  <br />
  -"c" is the speed of light (300,000km/s)
  <br />
  Basically special relativity is used mainly when huge energies, ultra-fast
  speeds and astronomical distances are manifested, all without the intervention
  of gravity.

  An example could be: In a hypothetical world where the speed of light is only
  40 km/h, all means of transport are restricted to not exceeding such speed. If
  a man needs to arrive for a job interview, he must request a taxi two hours in
  advance, even if the journey lasts only about 10 minutes. For the taxi driver,
  the journey lasts 10 minutes, but for the rest of the world, it lasts 2 hours.
  This is due to the deformation of time at speeds close to that of light.
  <br />
  <br />
  In this case, the taxi moves at a speed of 35 km/h, which is significantly
  lower than the speed of light. However, even at this relatively low speed,
  time warps, causing driver time and rest of the world time to be perceived
  differently.
  <br />
  <br />
  This raises interesting questions about the nature of time and speed, and how
  our perceptions of these concepts change as we approach the speed of light. If
  the taxi’s speed were closer to that of light, for example, time would warp
  even more, leading to even more extreme differences in the perception of time.
  <br />
  <br />
  In conclusion, special relativity describes the relationship between space and
  time for things moving at constant speed.

<h3>= The constancy of the speed of light in the universe =</h3>
<p>
  The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant with the value of
  299'792.458 m/s, although usually approaching 3 108 m/s. It is symbolized with
  the letter c ( means: speed )

<h3>= What special relativity has to do with time travel? =</h3>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<p>
  In the case of time travel, the theory of special relativity suggests that an
  object moving at very high speeds in space-time could experience time
  differently than we experience on Earth. This could open the possibility of
  traveling into the future, but not into the past. Example: A study NASA did on
  twins Scott and Mark Kelly. Which was that one of the brothers stayed in space
  for 340 days (2015 and 2016), while his twin stayed on earth; and the
  experiment proves that the astronaut aged less than his twin and had some body
  changes.
