<h3>General relativity</h3>
<p>
  General relativity is physicist Albert Einstein's understanding of how gravity
  affects the fabric of space-time.
  <br />
  <br />
  The theory, which Einstein published in 1915, expanded the theory of special
  relativity that he had published 10 years earlier. Special relativity argued
  that space and time are inextricably connected, but that theory didn't
  acknowledge the existence of gravity.
  <br />
  <br />
  Einstein spent the decade between the two publications determining that
  particularly massive objects warp the fabric of space-time, a distortion that
  manifests as gravity, according to NASA.
