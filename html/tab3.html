<h3>General relativity</h3>
<p>
  General relativity is physicist Albert Einstein's understanding of how gravity
  affects the fabric of space-time.
  <br />
  <br />
  The theory, which Einstein published in 1915, expanded the theory of special
  relativity that he had published 10 years earlier. Special relativity argued
  that space and time are inextricably connected, but that theory didn't
  acknowledge the existence of gravity.
  <br />
  <br />
  Einstein spent the decade between the two publications determining that
  particularly massive objects warp the fabric of space-time, a distortion that
  manifests as gravity, according to NASA.

  The spacetime interval is a kind of "distance" between events. But not the
  distance that separates events in space, nor the distance that separates them
  in time, but the distance that separates them using a measure that includes
  both space and time.
  <br />
  <br />
  Time and space, according to Einstein’s theories of relativity, are
  intertwined and form a four-dimensional fabric that we call "space-time". The
  mass of the Earth creates a cleft in this fabric, similar to what happens when
  a heavy person sits in the center of a trampoline.

  <br />
  Gravity is described as the effect on the fabric of spacetime caused by the
  presence of matter (or energy).
  <br />
  <br />
  The presence of the gravitational field of a mass affects time and space.
  Gravity causes clocks to lag. A clock on the Earth’s surface lags behind a
  clock on the Moon as the gravitational field on the Earth’s surface is larger
  than that of the lunar. The difference is small, but it can be measured.
  <br />
  <br />
  Gravity also acts on space, lengthening the size of objects (stretching them):
  a pole nailed to the surface of the Earth would be longer than one nailed to
  the surface of the Moon. Astronauts are a little taller on Earth than on the
  Moon.
  <br />
  <br />
  In this theory, gravitational effects are a consequence of the form of
  spacetime. If space-time is curved the objects it contains will move affected
  by that curvature and we can say that they are affected by gravity. As
  everything is contained in space-time, everything senses gravity and therefore
  moves with regard to its curvature.

  A black hole is a finite region of space within which there exists a
  concentration of mass so high and dense that it generates a gravitational
  field such that even light cannot escape it. These have a much stronger
  gravitational field than Earth, so close to it it needs a much higher velocity
  to escape its gravity force.
  <br />
  <br />
  Wormholes also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges, described in the equations of
  General Relativity, are a hypothetical topological feature of a Space-Time,
  which are a bridge or shortcut connecting two points of Space-Time, that would
  allow you to travel through them.
  <br />
  <br />
  We must be careful not to confuse black holes with wormholes, while black
  holes can detect and there is scientific evidence of anomalies that can
  generate, wormholes have not yet detected being scientifically able, because
  for its "creation" or "appearance" would have to occur an abnormal event like
  a twist in Space-Time that generates a space-time curvature.
